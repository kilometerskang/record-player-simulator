# COM SCI 174A Final Project

### Project Overview

Our project is separated into two components:
* Record player simulation
  * Basic controls: needle unlocking, needle rotating, disk spinning, volume adjusting
  * Music will only play when the needle is touching the disk and when the disk is spinning
  * Two different songs will play depending on the position of the needle
  * Smash button to transition to target shooting game with realistic disk shattering effect
* Target shooting game
  * Use ‘w’/‘a’/ ‘s’/ ‘d’ controls to move the tank left, right, up and down. 
  * Rotate its cannon left and right using ‘q’ and ‘e’
  * Shoot small disks with the space bar
  * Shooting a target awards 12 points
  * The player has a maximum of 3 shots which recharge over time
  * The player also expends 2 points per shot
  * Projectiles will break upon hitting a target and create a realistic shattering effect with particles affected by gravity
  * Projectiles will not break upon hitting a wall and instead correctly ricochet
  * Targets respawn randomly with no overlap
  * Game over if projectile hits the player or time runs out
  * Score 100 points to win
Note: The player may switch between third and first person cameras to make shooting targets easier

### Team Members and Contributions

* Joshua Young
